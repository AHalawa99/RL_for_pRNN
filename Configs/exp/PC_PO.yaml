pRNN: False # Wether to use pRNN for spatial input
PC: True # Wether to use fake place cells for spatial input
CANN: False # Wether to use CANN for spatial input
recurrence: 1 # Wether to use RNN for memory (1 = don't use, other number = number of recurrent steps)
with_obs: True # Wether to include visual input (in case of recurrency the one that would bypass RNN)
rgb: True # Is visual input RGB?
intrinsic: False
